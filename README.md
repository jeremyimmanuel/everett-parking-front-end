## Problem
Residents and visitors find it difficult to find on street parking within the downtown area of Everett. Past parking utilization studies have shown there may be enough parking stalls in the downtown, but public perception is parking availability is a challenge.

## Solution
A mobile app that lets users see parking lots in Everett's downtown area based on Everett's 2015 Central Business District Parking map (https://coughacks.io/datasets/CBD%20PARKING%202015-Map.pdf).

We have separates repoes for the Front-end side (a mobile application) and the Back-end side (a sql-backed python flask server). You can visit the repoes through the link below:

# Front End
## Two Platforms, One Codebase

For this project, we have decided to adopt Google's Flutter SDK to develop our app. For those of you who don't know, Flutter is a cross platform mobile app development that lets you develop both android and iOS applications all in one code base, written in Dart. R
